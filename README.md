Why this Project :
I’ve chosen "The Final Bell: Chronicles of Our Last School Day" because it combines both emotional reflection and humor, making it an engaging and unique project for students. The concept allows for deep, personal introspection about an important milestone—graduation or the end of school—while also embracing the silliness of imagining what the future might hold in a fun, light-hearted way. This balance of seriousness and humor makes it relatable, engaging, and a joy for students to interact with.
